## Abstract

pytest lets you write simple tests fast - but also scales to very complex scenarios: Beyond the basics of no-boilerplate test functions, this training will show various intermediate/advanced features, as well as gems and tricks.

To attend this training, you should already be familiar with the pytest basics (e.g. writing test functions, parametrize, or what a fixture is) and want to learn how to take the next step to improve your test suites.

If you're already familiar with things like fixture caching scopes, autouse, or using the built-in `tmp_path`/`monkeypatch`/... fixtures: There will probably be some slides about concepts you already know, but there are also various little hidden tricks and gems I'll be showing.

## Description

We'll cover things like:

- Recommended pytest settings for more strictness
- What's xfail and why is it useful?
- How to mark an entire test file or single parameters
- Ways to deal with parametrize IDs and syntax
- Useful built-in pytest fixtures
- Caching for fixtures
- Using fixtures implicitly
- Advanced fixture and parametrization topics
- How to customize fixtures behavior based on markers or custom CLI arguments
- Patching, mocking, and alternatives
- Various useful plugins, and how to write your own
- Short intro to property-based testing with Hypothesis

My name (and pronouns) changed, but I'm still the same person :)

Regarding "already presented and recorded": Essentially this is the same tutorial [as at PyConDE 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG_DgVo0hU0), but as always there are minor updates and improvements to the material from feedback gathered during my company trainings.
