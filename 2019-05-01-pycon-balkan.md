## Talk
### Information

- Title: "**Testing PySide/PyQt code easily using the pytest framework**"
- Length: 30 minutes (25 minutes + 5 minutes Q/A)
- Level: Advanced
- Tags: Tools, Framework
- Session format: Talk

### Description

*(WIP, mostly copy-pasted from QtWS)*

Both PySide and PyQt allow rapid prototyping and development of Qt applications
using the Python programming language. However, the Qt Test framework is focused
on C++, and only a subset of its functionality is available in Python.
Together with the "unittest" module in the Python standard library (which exposes
a heavyweight, xUnit-like API), this can make tests unnecessarily cumbersome to
write.

The pytest framework coupled with the pytest-qt plugin allows writing tests for
Qt/Python code in a much more straightforward and fun way. It exposes the
QTestLib API, but also adds various high-level functionality with an API which
is more suitable for Python code.

This talk will give the audience a short introduction to pytest and explain how
to test Python/Qt code using the pytest-qt plugin. It will also take a quick
look at other useful pytest plugins which can be combined with pytest-qt.
