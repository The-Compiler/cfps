## Talk information

- Title: "**pytest - simple, rapid and fun testing with Python**"
- Length: 3h (FIXME)

## Abstract

The py.test tool presents a rapid and simple way to write tests for your Python code. This training gives a quick introduction with exercises into some distinguishing features. We’ll do exercises where we get existing non-pytest test suites to run with pytest and discuss migration strategies. We’ll finish with discussing topics and questions of participants related to their own test suites and usages.

**If you want to participate, please install pytest (e.g. in a virtualenv) before the training and download the [code examples](FIXME).**

This is the planned outline:

- (30 minutes) pytest feature walkthrough: automatic test discovery, assert statement, modular parametrizable fixtures, 150 plugins (FIXME)
- (60 minutes) pytest fixture mechanism: dependency injection, declaring and using function/module/session scoped fixtures, using fixtures from fixture functions, parametrizing fixtures. Exercises.
- (30 minutes): running nose/unittest/trial/Django suites with pytest. Discussing advantages and limitations. Exercise with a select existing real-life open source project.
- (30 minutes): Strategies for a) migrating to pytest b) using “autouse” fixtures in conjunction with XUnit-based setup/tearodwn methods. Exercise.
- (30 minutes): open space for questions and interactively solving pytest/unittest integration problems on real-life problems as time permits.
