## Biography

[Florian Bruhin](https://bruhin.software/) ("The Compiler") is a long-time
contributor and maintainer of both the [pytest](https://www.pytest.org/)
framework and various plugins. In 2013, he started the
[qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org) project, a keyboard-focused web
browser based on Python and Qt. In 2015, he discovered pytest - since then, he
has given talks and conducted workshops about pytest at various conferences and
companies.

## Training
### Information

- Title: "**pytest - simple, rapid and fun testing with Python**"
- Length: 90min (actually 3h)
- Domains: Best Practice, Development Methods, 
- Domain Expertise: none *(none/some/expert/guru)*
- Python Skill Level: some *(none/some/expert/guru)*

### Abstract

*200-1500 chars*

The pytest tool presents a rapid and simple way to write tests for your Python
code. This training gives an introduction with exercises to some distinguishing
features. We'll also examine how to run existing non-pytest test suites and
discuss migration strategies. Various plugins which extend pytest's
functionality even further will be introduced.

### Description

*400-50000 chars*

*The workshop uses Python 3.7 or later, it'd be good if you could set it up before the workshop starts. If you know how, set up a virtualenv with pytest installed - if you don't, that's no problem, I'll cover it at the beginning of the workshop! The material will apply to both pytest 6.2 and 7.x.*

This is the planned outline:

- (30 minutes) pytest feature walkthrough:
  * Automatic test discovery
  * Assertions without boilerplate via the assert statement
  * Configuration and commandline options
  * Marking and skipping tests
  * Data-driven tests via parametrization
  * Exercises / Live demos

- (60 minutes) pytest fixture mechanism:
  * Setup and teardown via dependency injection
  * Declaring and using function/module/session scoped fixtures
  * Using fixtures from fixture functions
  * Parametrizing fixtures
  * Looking at useful built-in fixtures (managing temporary files, patching, output capturing)
  * Advanced fixture features: Caching, cleanup, implicit fixture use
  * Exercises / Live demos

- (15 minutes): Running existing unittest suites with pytest:
  * Discussing advantages and limitations
  * Strategies for migrating to pytest

- (60 minutes): Plugin ecosystem:
  * Examples of available plugins
  * Property-based testing (automated testcase generation) via Hypothesis
  * Overview of useful plugins
  * Writing custom plugins (quick overview)
  * Various live demos

- (15 minutes): Open space for questions:
  * Leftover questions from the training
  * Other topics depending on interest
  * Buffer if we end up spending more time on something

**Basic Python OOP knowledge (e.g. what a class/instance is) is required.**

Note that the structure of the workshop is similar to the ones I've given at previous PyConDE 2019, but with updated material.

### Organizer Notes

Adjusted descripton for a 3h slot, as communicated to me by Alexander Hendorf.

I've also given longer versions (3h/1d/3d) at Europython and in companies, see my website for an overview: [Bruhin Software](https://bruhin.software/).

### Reviewer Notes

Already given at PyCon 2019 ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMuSn9cofbI)) - there was a lot of interest there and the room was overflowing, so I think there will be a lot of interest in it again.
